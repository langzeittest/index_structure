Module: Index Structure
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Oliver Riesen <oliver@riesen.org>

Use different structure for root and folders on index page.

Phorum has in General Setting an option how to display forums and folders on
the index page: directory and flat. Flat structure is appropriate for a small
amount of folders and forums. Directory structure is best for large system with
a lot of folders and forums.

But what to do if you have a large root with a lot of folders but each folders
contains only few subfolders/forums? Or the opposite: few folders in root but
many subfolders/forums in each folder?

Here you can use the Index Structure Module. It will use the value from general
settings for the root and the opposite value for all folders. So if you choose
"Directory" in general settings your root will be structured as directory but
folders will displayed in flat structure.

Tested on version 5.2.7
